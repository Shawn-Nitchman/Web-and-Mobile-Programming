    <h3>The premise of Halo</h3>
    <p>
        In the year 2525, human worlds come under attack by a theocratic alliance of alien races known as the Covenant. <br>
        The Covenant's <em>superior technology and numbers</em> prove decisive advantages; though effective, the Spartans are too <br>
        few in number to turn the tide of battle in humanity's favor. <strong>Master Chief John 117</strong> is one of the few remaining Spartans left.
